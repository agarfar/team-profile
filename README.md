# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application allows users to generate HTML depicting team members and their roles within an organization. During the design of this application, I learned how to use the 'inquirer', 'fs' packages within node.js to take user input and dynamically generate functional HTML files. I also practiced using the 'jest' package to test my javascript classes and their associated methods/properties.
